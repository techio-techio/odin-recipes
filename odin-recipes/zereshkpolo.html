    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Rice:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fully wash and then soak the rice in cool water, add 4 tablespoons of
        salt, set aside for at least an hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large non-stick pot bring 8 cups of water to a rapid boil on
        medium-high heat. Drain the rice and pour into boiling water. Bring
        water back to a boil for about 7 minutes. Test to see if the rice is
        ready. Rice grains should be hard in the centre and soft on the outside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the rice in a colander and rinse with cool water a few times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash the rice pot with water. Add oil or butter to the bottom of the pot
        and place flatbread such as Lavash or pitta. With a large spatula return
        the parboiled rice into the pot over the bread, building it into a
        pyramid shape away from the sides of the pot. In order to release the
        steam make 4-5 holes in the rice with the bottom of the spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for 7-10 minutes on medium heat until the rice starts steaming,
        pour 1/4 cup of water over the rice, cover, lower heat and steam the
        rice for about 40-45 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Barberries:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash and rinse the barberries a few times, soak in cool water for 15
        minutes, then drain (this prevents them from burning fast).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 2 tablespoon of butter in a small saucepan, add barberries to the
        pan, heat it up on medium-low heat for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 tablespoons of liquid saffron and pistachios with the rosewater,
        then sugar to balance the sour taste of barberry.
      </li>
      <li>
        When all mix thoroughly, don’t let them fry any longer than 30 seconds
        so barberries don’t burn, remove from heat, and set aside.
      </li>
    </ol>
